**Overview:** We have created a fan page for the NFL. The History page gives an overview of the entire history of the NFL. The Highlights page shows a few videos including highlights from different teams and seasons. The Team Viewer page allows you to view information about each team when you press on their corresponding button. 

**Agile details:** We had three sprints that all lasted approximately one week. We used the Axosoft software to keep track of our progress throughout the entire project. We started off with creating the individual pages on the website. During the second sprint, we worked on gathering all of the information for the teams and adding the button functionality. During the third sprint, we worked on styling and wrapping up any stories that got left behind.
